# HIGHER_LEVEL_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE

* Higher level programming refers to the use of programming languages that are more abstract and require less low-level knowledge than machine code or assembly language. Higher level languages are designed to be easier to use and allow developers to focus more on problem-solving and algorithm development rather than on low-level implementation details.

* Examples of higher level programming languages include Python, Java, Ruby, and JavaScript. These languages provide a wide range of built-in functions and libraries that make it easier to write complex programs. They also have powerful features like garbage collection and dynamic memory allocation, which simplify memory management for developers.

### Higher level programming can help developers to write code more quickly and with fewer errors than low-level programming. This is because the abstractions and libraries provided by higher level languages can automate many common programming tasks and reduce the need for manual coding. Additionally, higher level programming can make code more maintainable, since it is often easier to understand and modify than low-level code.

* Overall, higher level programming is an important tool for developers who want to write complex programs quickly and efficiently, without getting bogged down in low-level implementation details.
